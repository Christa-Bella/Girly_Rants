<h2>What to Wear to brunch</h2>
<p>After all the planning in the group chat, where your brunch will be, 
what time you will meet, you get left with one question which is, what I will wear for brunch, 
it's a struggle I know. But the first thing I think everyoneâ€‚needs to consider is the weather,
 is it hot or freezing cold, after that you decide on what shoes you need to wear, are you comfortable with heels or just flats? 
 is it a special occasion? 
do you need make up? am already stressed thinking about it anyway part 2 loading ......
