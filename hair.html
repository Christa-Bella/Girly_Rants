<h2>Hair day!</h2>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My hair is my pride, growing up I thought there were people who were blessed with good hair genetics of long and voluminous hair and I didnt think I was one of them, I had accepted my fate till a few years later I came across a video on youtube explaining hair types, well basically there are four types of hair; straight, wavy, curly and coily, I managed to do a deep research of hair types, on youtube lol, and I found certain techniques that work for my hair type, we can all take care of our hair so that it grows longer and healthier, here are some of the thing that made my hair grow longer and healthier.</p>

<li>Protective styling - Our hair as much as it looks hard and rough really needs to be treated gently, because it breaks so easily, protective styles are the best way to protect our hair, examples are braids that are not tight, cornrows, bantu knots, just to mention a few, you just have to found a couple of styles that look good on you and still protect your hair.</li>

<li>Wash routine -Having a regular routine will help you plan for and wash your hair regularly, since our scalp gets a build up of all the oil, dust and products we put on our hair we need to regurlarly clean it so there is healthy hair growth. When washing concetrate the shampoo on your scalp, and the conditioner on the hair so it is easy to detangle.</li>

<li>Wash day - A wash day is an important day and it takes time, a lot of time sometimes, because you need to wash, detangle, moisturise the hair and add in a protective styling. What you need is a shampoo, conditioner, deep mask, leave in treatment, oils(Coconut oil, castor oil), a detangling brush(wide tooth comb) and some hair ties. You wet your hair first, apply shampoo, make sure the scalp is clean, then add the conditioner mostly to your hair, only when your hair is smooth that's when you start detangling, if its really knotted up, you can detangle with your hands first, then the comb, when using the comb start from the ends to the roots, so you dont cause breakage, be generous with your conditioner, after you rinse out the conditioner you can either deep mask for 30 mins or so, or you now just seal in the moisture, you can section the hair, apply the leave in section by section then apply oil, then you can cornrow or twist or put a protective style of your choice till it dries, more about protective styles later.</li>

<li>Deep masks- There are a variety of deep masks, the benefit of a mask is that it helps replenish and restores hair moisture, you have to add this to your wash routine, you dont have to do it every time you wash, but atleast once a month, you can try Cantu deep conditioning masks or Vatika deep conditioning mask(Bentonite clay), this will help the hair restore its shine and curl definition.</li>

<li>Avoid heat- Type 4 hair is coily and constantly straighting causes heat damage.</li>
