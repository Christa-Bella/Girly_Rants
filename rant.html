<p>Adulting sucks, I think we can all agree on that, the stress that comes with being responsible for everything, and getting to understand why our parents never had money, it's really a lot of pressure, but in as much as that drains all the money out of our pocket, you get to have the freedom to do choose where our dreams takes us. I hate having to plan for the money I am yet to receive, but I love that I have that choice, to decide what will make me broke. And honestly I think our 20s are for figuring things out, atleast that is what I have heard from social media. I don't think anyone ever knows what they are doing and that's okey, but I think having a guideline to this chaos can help, among the things I have tried is just having a budget of the things that must be taken care of first, that ensures I don't become homeless since I am a spendthrift.</p>

<p>In as much as it is stressful, I am grateful for this life, I am grateful for the people I have met along the way, the books I have read that have shifted my perspective, the lessons that I have learned that make me who I am, the experiences that I have been able to afford. Money is good and I want lots and lots of it, but I want  to have more of those moments that are priceless.</p>
