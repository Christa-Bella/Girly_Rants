<li>Applying Sunscreen - Having Suncreen in your beauty kit is essential, Suncreen protects us from the harmful rays of the sun, that cause damage to our skin such as drying and darkening.There are sunscreen for the face as well as for the body, when buying suncreen look for Sunscreen that is spf 50 and above, Nivea has a good range.Here is a video about other benefits of sunscreen <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4ZbZMV8Ntxs&amp;si=8YZVzWDfRV-zHaFo">https://youtube.com/watch?v=4ZbZMV8Ntxs&amp;si=8YZVzWDfRV-zHaFo</a></li>

<li>Hats and sunglasses - well if you cant afford suncreen or you've tried your Suncreen tube or bottle and there is nothing coming out because you are yet to buy another one, and you need to go somewhere, wearing a hat  protects you, especially if its a wide hat, consider having a bucket hat in your wardrobe, as for sunglasses they help you see properly in the sun without squinting. Squinting speeds up the forming of wrinkles on your forehead and around the eyes.</li>

<li>Kimono(Cover ups) - in the same line with hats, Kimonos help cover your body from direct sunlight, every skin on your body is important and should be equally protected. You can style kimonos with your jeans and top, even with dresses, good thing about kimonos is that they are not that heavy, so you won't be sweating alot. protecting your skin while still looking good, that's the goal.</li>
