<h2>Entering a new phase of your life</h2>
<p>As we grow and overcome various obstacles in our life we are forced to evolve and do better 
than we ever have, thats why the universe repeats the same lessons till we are ready to learn. Entering a new phase of
 your life is good and scary at the same time bacause you are now starting on a clean state, you no longer follow your old patterns.
 Its a chance to experience life and happiness like you have never before, dont be scared, actually be 
scared but still embrace it.You are either going to jump or be pushed.
