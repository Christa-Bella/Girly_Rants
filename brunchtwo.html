<h2>What to wear to brunch 2.0</h2>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is my little silly thoughts on what you should consider when getting ready for brunch or maybe a date, enjoy lol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Weather - the first thing to consider is weather conditions, is it cold or hot. Having the right sweater can break or make your outfit, so if its cold and you want to wear boots and jeans you can either style it with a trench coat or a puffer coat.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Makeup- Makeup is essential, important I could say, not because you need to alter how you look, but because putting effort into your appearance makes you feel confident in your self, it could be something as simple as putting on your sunscreen to protect your face from the sun, doing your skin prep in the morning, just doing your soap brows, there is nothing antifeminist about wanting to look pretty and sexy.</li>

<li>Shoes- shoes are a girl bestfriend, well besides your bestie, for me purses are my bestfriend but well, we are here to talk about shoes, brunch is usually in a good hotel where you can wear your heels and walk comfortable, its not dealing with a psycho who want your first date to be hiking, anyway, heels or no heels doesnt matter as long as you are confident and comfortable, but i would prefer kitten heels so I am able to walk around comfortably.</li>

<li>Dress or no dress- personally it doesnt matter really, you can rock the romper with heels and sneakers and still look cute, its all about embracing your femininity, whatever that means for you.</li>
