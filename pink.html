<h2>Pink girl lifestyle</h2>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Life is so much worth living, seeing the sunrise, birds chirping, it brings me so much happiness that I will never be able to explain. I just love mornings, it's like a fresh start, a new beginning, you get to decide how your day goes, well most of the time if you have a plan like what we talked about, in the previous article, girlctivities, well 'I am just a girl' is the phrase, because the simple things of life bring me so much joy; the sunsets,the trees, milkshakes, the world is just amazing, but as we go day by day, we need to think about the future, about where we want to be, our goals, dreams, ambition. Every birthday I usually write a list of goal, well I did this year, I had accomplished some of the goals I set in January and I got to add more.</p>

<p>Having objectives really sets you up, gives you something to wake up to, as women we are often told our end game is getting married and having kids, which is not a bad thing, but we need to have goals, how to make more money, to travel the world, explore, be more open to different culture, so basically what are your goals? and how do you plan on achieving them? simple rules I follow while getting to know what I need to work on.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A money plan - Well in as much as the most important things are free, like the air we breath, we need money to survive, so making sure you have plans to sustain yourself in the long run is a good place to start. Think about a savings account, or maybe you need to work more to get some extra money, knowing where you are in your finances and where you want to be, helps you know where to put more effort in, if its saving or investing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Health - Its easy to neglect your health and what you eat, but taking care of your health is a habit to incorporate, excercising is not only about reducing weight or getting abs, although that is a valid reason to excercise, but it also boosts your self esteem, helps you feel lighter and you get endorphins, so trying a good excercise routine, and eating healthy once in a while is a good thing to add to your goals list.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Hobbies - Get something you love to do, maybe play tennis once or week, or do a paint class with friends, life needs to be enjoyed, not just focusing on making ends meet.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Just create a Vision board - There are so many categories of which we want to work on to improve ourselves, if you want to improve your fashion, you can just add a cute picture of that on your vision board, if you want to travel more or just have long hair, you can put all that on a vision board, and remember to do weekly activities to help you achieve that; if its washing your hair weekly, or buying quality pieces for your wardrobe. I hope you got some insight on how to make a list of goals.</li>
