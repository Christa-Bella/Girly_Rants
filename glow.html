<h2>Skin glow up!</h2>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a previous article we talked about making sure your skin is protected from the sun, after highschool or if you are just starting on this skincare journey you may not have a lot of money to invest in skin care products, and since you are just beginning you may not want to spend a fortune on the wrong products, here are a few things you can do for skincare before you are sure on the right products to get.</p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A routine - Having a routine for washing your face helps you makes sure you have time to take care of your skin on busy days, washing your face in the morning with lukewarm water to open your pores to be able to take in the products you apply, in the evening use soap or cleanser if you have one, to clear out the build up of dirt that you have accumulated during the day, just clean thoroughly after you have been out for long, but do not be too harsh on your face.</li>

<li>Use soap before you get the cleanser- Have a separate soap for your face, you can get dove original beauty bar, dettol original antibacterial soap, this could help clear out germs and dirt to help with acne, this are cheaper options before you are able to invest in a good cleanser.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Using aloevera or coconut oil- Coconut oil has many benefits to the skin, if you dont have acne prone skin, you can add coconut oil to your routine as a moisturizer. If you have oily skin it will be better if you use aloevera to avoid clogging your pores and causing more damage, aloevera can also be used a a moisturizer, if you can get the gel from the plant its even better, but be cautious of allergic reactions. Here are are some vidoes on the benefits of coconut and aloevera. <strong><em><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=48oenvDIm0g&amp;si=iN_q3xFbzwrrsWZj  "><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f06161" class="has-inline-color"><span style="text-decoration: underline">https://youtube.com/watch?v=48oenvDIm0g&amp;si=iN_q3xFbzwrrsWZj  </span></mark></a></em><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ko598akHjQk&amp;si=g59Vh4O1zesLP-Jn"><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#da6262" class="has-inline-color"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>https://youtube.com/watch?v=ko598akHjQk&amp;si=g59Vh4O1zesLP-Jn</em></span></mark></a></strong></li>

<li>Face towels - You can get a few microfibre towels just for your face one for washing another one for rinsing, always make sure your face towels are clean and after you wash them put in direct sunlight to dry and kill bacteria, I think thats a fact that sunlight kills bacteria. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Avoid touching your face unnecessarily- Our hands touch a lot of things hence could be a carrier for a lot of bacteria, avoid touching your face unnecessarily, and also tell other people not to touch your face "my face dont touch" is the mantra.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Avoid picking on pimples - Picking on your pimples causes scarring which will be hard to get rid of in the long run, if the pimple is there avoid the urge to pick on it, use an antibacterial soap to clean and let it serve its time, it will go away eventually.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Know when something is reacting to your face -Before you buy a product put a small amount on your arm to see if it reacts,if it initially doesn't react and only starts reacting with your face after you have used it for a while, you need to stop using, also before buying a beauty product always check for reviews, obviously not all reviews will be good but they should be more positive reviews than negative ones.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>

<p>All our skin are different what might work for one, might not work for the other, with a little trial and error you can get the perfect skincare routine for you, the most important thing is learning when to stop using a product if its not working for you.</p>
