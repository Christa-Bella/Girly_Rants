<h2>Girlctivities</h2>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a good daily routine helps you keep track of what you need to do, you get to have time to work, have time for a good skincare routine, excercise, sleep on time and still wake up early,even though I know this I still struggle to stick to a routine, I wake up late and tired to do anything productive, then sleep late binge watching, before I know it the weekend is already here, I go out to party only to recover on Tuesday, just to waste the next week, but I want to change that and be a more productive girly, so some of the girlctivities I plan on doing are;</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Wake up early - This is a struggle, so guess it all starts with sleeping early, I feel like waking early requires you to have something you are looking forwad to doing the next day or maybe just a job that pays your bills, I think thats enough motivation, so I am going to have a morning routine, I wake up, listen to a podcast, meditate, then stretch, shower before I even start checking my texts, this way I dont feel overwhelmed immediately I wake up, trying to respond to texts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Go to bed early - This will help me wake up early, I need to have enough rest so I can function within the day and well beauty sleep too, the evening routine; no more watching tv past 10 pm, I have to journal, meditate or both, take a shower, and not be on my phone 30 minutes before I go to bed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Planning what I need to do for the week - I will know what I need to prioritise, knowing what is important helps me give that more time, then planning for the next day each night, this way when I wake up, I just know what I need to do and don't need to overthink it.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Excercise-  Saying I excercise everyday is a lie, so lets say three or four days of excercise, I think thats enough.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Eat healthy- I think this will go with exercising so I just be healthy</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Not going out every weekend uhm well this is a hard one, so thats all I got to say on that point</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Find Balance- Once I find balance I feel like everything will fall into place, I can give enough time to my relationships, and I can also show up for me more, I think if I follow this for a month my life will be better, well we will see.</li>
